# Local development

## Work in this checkout

Opening this checkout in a trusted Copilot CLI session makes every local plugin
available from the working files. The repository overlay,
[.github/copilot/settings.json](../.github/copilot/settings.json), declares
this directory as a marketplace and enables each plugin. No global install is
needed, and edits take effect in the next session.

```sh
npm ci
npm run verify
copilot
```

Accept the folder-trust prompt for this checkout. The CLI ignores an untrusted
checkout's repository settings, so if the plugins are missing, check folder
trust first. Trusting the checkout lets every local plugin run, including its
hooks and MCP servers, so trust it only if you'd install all of them. Don't
install the plugins globally just to make local discovery work. Host trust
prompts and managed policy still apply.

To try a plugin in another project, pass it explicitly with an absolute path:

```sh
copilot --plugin-dir /absolute/path/to/plugins/<name>
```

## Work in VS Code

VS Code runs plugins in its chat and Agents window. What a plugin can do there
depends on the session's harness, which you pick with the **Session Target**
control:

- The **Copilot** harness uses the same runtime as Copilot CLI and the GitHub
  Copilot app, so skills, agents, MCP servers, and hooks in the Copilot CLI
  format behave as they do in the CLI.
- The **Local** harness is VS Code's own. It runs skills, agents, and MCP
  servers, but it sends hooks a different event, so a hook written for the Copilot CLI
  format can't do its job there.

[Where each type works](customization-types.md#where-each-type-works) has the
full table, with the sources.

To test a plugin you haven't pushed yet, register its folder with the
`chat.pluginLocations` setting, which VS Code marks Experimental:

```json
"chat.pluginLocations": {
  "/absolute/path/to/your-marketplace/plugins/release-notes": true
}
```

Then start a new chat, confirm the plugin's skills appear in
**Chat: Configure Skills**, and run a task that uses it. See
[use local plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-plugins#_use-local-plugins).
VS Code reads this repository's overlay as
[workspace plugin recommendations](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-plugins#_workspace-plugin-recommendations)
and offers the listed plugins; whether it accepts the overlay's local-directory
marketplace source isn't verified here. VS Code also picks up plugins you
install with Copilot CLI. Make sure agent plugins are turned on with
`chat.plugins.enabled`.

The model-free checks, `npm run verify`, the eval tooling, and the
installation test below all use Node.js and the pinned Copilot CLI from
`npm ci`, so even a VS Code-first author needs the terminal for those.

## Test installation without publishing

This checks what a teammate's `copilot plugin install` does, without starting a
session, calling a model, or touching your own Copilot setup. It uses an
isolated Copilot home and the CLI version this repository pins, and it runs from
a directory outside the checkout so the checkout's own overlay doesn't mix in.
Replace `MARKETPLACE` with the `name` in `marketplace.json` and `PLUGIN` with
the plugin to install.

PowerShell:

```powershell
$repo = "C:\path\to\your-marketplace"          # your checkout
$env:COPILOT_HOME = "$env:TEMP\copilot-install-check"
$env:COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE = "false"            # run the pinned CLI version
$copilot = "$repo\node_modules\.bin\copilot.cmd"
Push-Location $env:TEMP                       # outside the checkout
& $copilot plugin marketplace add $repo
& $copilot plugin install PLUGIN@MARKETPLACE
& $copilot plugin list --json
Pop-Location
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force $env:COPILOT_HOME
Remove-Item Env:COPILOT_HOME, Env:COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE
```

bash or zsh:

```sh
repo=/path/to/your-marketplace                 # your checkout
export COPILOT_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
export COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false              # run the pinned CLI version
copilot="$repo/node_modules/.bin/copilot"
cd "$COPILOT_HOME"                            # outside the checkout
"$copilot" plugin marketplace add "$repo"
"$copilot" plugin install PLUGIN@MARKETPLACE
"$copilot" plugin list --json
cd - >/dev/null; rm -rf "$COPILOT_HOME"; unset COPILOT_HOME COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE
```

If you'd rather keep the isolated home inside the checkout, `.copilot-home/` is
gitignored; still run the commands from another directory.

Expect `Plugin "PLUGIN" installed successfully` and, in the JSON list, an entry
for it with `"enabled": true` and `"source": "live"`. A local-directory
marketplace lists all of its plugins, so the ones you didn't install appear with
`"enabled": false`. That's expected.

What this does and doesn't prove:

- A local path is registered live: Copilot reads the plugin from your checkout,
  and nothing is copied. Only an install from your GitHub repository proves the
  published layout, so test that before you share it: push, then
  `copilot plugin marketplace add OWNER/REPO` in a fresh isolated home.
- Installing doesn't run anything, so it doesn't prove that a hook fires, an
  MCP server starts, or a canvas renders. The install message counts skills
  only; a plugin whose `hooks.json` or extension has a mistake looks the same
  as one that works. The model-free tests and the evals cover behavior; check
  the hosts you support by hand too, as described below.
- Remote plugins can't be tested this way. Copilot treats every plugin in a
  local-directory marketplace as a live local folder, so it removes a
  downloaded remote plugin on the next command. See
  [Test a remote entry](remote-plugins.md#test-a-remote-entry).

`npm run verify` runs a similar check for every local plugin in
`test/installation.test.mjs`, from a copy of the plugins in a temporary
Copilot home.

## Pinned Copilot CLI

The repository pins `@github/copilot` in `package.json`, and the eval tooling
uses that version. Copilot CLI's auto-update downloads newer releases into a
package cache and launches the newest one, so outside CI the pinned package can
report a later version. Set `COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false`, as above, to run the
pinned binary. The eval runtime bridge does this for you, and
`node scripts/eval-runtime.js --version` prints both the pinned package version
and the version that runs.

## Troubleshooting

- **`npm run verify` says dependencies aren't installed.** Run `npm ci` first.
- **`npm test` seems slow.** The adoption and installation tests copy the
  repository and install every plugin into temporary Copilot homes, so the test
  step takes about a minute.
- **A test fails with `MCP error -32001: Request timed out`.** A test process
  that starts a real MCP server didn't answer in time, usually because the
  machine was busy. The tests allow up to 30 seconds; run the failing file
  alone, for example `node --test test/brainstorm-eval-host.test.mjs`, to
  confirm it passes, and report it if it keeps failing.

## Before a release

- Open the trusted checkout and confirm every plugin is enabled without a global
  install, and that its skills and agents are discovered.
- Install from your GitHub repository in a separate test environment and
  confirm the same plugins.
- Run through each plugin's `## Host checks` in its README, in every host you
  support. `npm run new-plugin` writes that section for you.
  <!-- examples -->
  [Examples](examples.md) lists the checks for the shipped examples.
  <!-- /examples -->

Automated tests and evals don't replace these checks. For each type, check:

- **Skills:** a request that should use the skill does, and an unrelated one
  doesn't.
- **Custom agents:** the agent is listed, can be selected or delegated to, and
  uses only the tools it lists.
- **MCP servers:** the server starts, its tools are listed, and a call returns
  the expected result. Check it in every host your team uses.
- **Hooks:** a single edit, a multi-file edit, and `apply_patch` each trigger
  it; a failed edit and an unrelated tool don't; its message appears in the
  conversation. In VS Code, check both the Copilot and Local harnesses if
  people use both.
- **Canvases:** the panel opens; a change from the agent shows in the panel and
  a change in the panel is visible to the agent; keyboard focus survives an
  update; closing and reopening the panel keeps the session's state; a new
  session starts empty; and in a host without canvases, the skill falls back
  to chat. In VS Code, also check what happens after **Developer: Reload
  Window**.
