# Evals

Evals check what Copilot actually does with a plugin: that it loads the right
skill, calls the right tool or agent, and produces the right outcome.
[Vally](https://microsoft.github.io/vally/) runs them. It's a development
dependency pinned in `package.json`; installed plugins never need it.

```sh
npm ci
npm run verify                         # model-free, free
npm run eval:list -- --suite smoke     # free: lists the cases a run would select
npm run eval:smoke                     # real Copilot sessions, costs AI credits
npm run eval:report -- --suite smoke
npm run eval                           # every case, costs more
npm run eval:report -- --suite full
```

`verify` runs source checks, the generated-file freshness check, tests, the
eval coverage check, and strict Vally linting. It never calls a model.
`eval:smoke` and `eval` run real Copilot sessions. Authenticate using the
[Vally runtime setup](https://microsoft.github.io/vally/get-started/runtime-setup/).
The baseline model is `gpt-5.4-mini`; override it with `--model MODEL_ID`.
Local runs use one worker, per-case timeouts, and one bounded retry for a
timeout or rate limit. A valid failed verdict isn't retried to get a pass.

## Run only the plugins you changed

A plugin can have more than one spec, such as `evals/<name>/eval.yaml` and
`evals/<name>/agent/eval.yaml`, so running `evals/<name>/eval.yaml` alone can
miss cases. `--plugin` selects every
spec under `evals/<name>/`, at any depth, plus any spec with a case that tags
one of the plugin's assets. Check the selection for free first:

```sh
npm run eval:list -- --plugin <name>
```

That prints each spec and case it would run and the exact commands. Then run
and report on the same selection. Repeat `--plugin` for several plugins:

```sh
node scripts/evals.mjs eval --plugin <name> --plugin <other-name>
npm run eval:report -- --plugin <name> --plugin <other-name>
```

`--eval-spec <path>` still selects one spec, and you can repeat it.
`npm run eval:report -- --help` lists the report's options.

## Cost

Each case runs at least one Copilot session, and a retried case runs again.
`npm run eval:check` prints how many cases each suite has, and
`npm run eval:list` names them. Copilot bills model usage in AI credits based
on the model and the tokens used, so the cost of a case depends on how much
work it does. A one-turn chat case costs less than a case that delegates to a
custom agent or edits files. See
[usage-based billing for organizations and enterprises](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing-and-usage/organizations-and-enterprises/billing)
and [for individuals](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing-and-usage/individuals/billing),
and check your billing dashboard after a run to learn what your suite costs.

## Write an eval

1. Create `evals/<plugin>/eval.yaml` with realistic tasks, expected outcomes,
   and at least one negative or non-trigger case. The upstream
   [github/evals](https://github.com/github/evals) convention,
   `<name>.eval.yaml`, works too; `evalFilenames` in `.vally.yaml` lists both.
   Keep private production data out of fixtures and expected answers out of
   agent-visible inputs. Put grader programs and answer keys in
   `grading_environment`.
2. Load the actual asset, rather than pasting its instructions into the task:
   - Skill: list its directory in `agent_environment.skills`, relative to the
     eval file, such as `../../plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill>`.
   - Custom agent: copy its real `.agent.md` file to
     `.github/agents/<name>.agent.md` with `agent_environment.files`.
   - MCP server: configure it in `agent_environment.mcpServers`, and pass its
     path through a `.vally.yaml` param so the launcher can make it absolute.
   - Hook: set `agent_environment.env.STARTER_PLUGIN_DIRS` to the plugin
     directory, such as `plugins/<plugin>`. Separate several with commas.
3. Assert both invocation and outcome:
   - Skills use `skill-invocation` with `required`, plus an outcome grader.
   - Agents need a `tool-calls` assertion for `^task$` with the exact
     `agent_type`, then a subagent-scoped outcome grader. The default agent's
     answer isn't proof that the custom agent ran.
   - MCP tools need a `tool-calls` rule with the tool name and its actual
     `result`.
   - Hooks need evidence that the hook itself ran. See [Hooks](#hooks).
   - Extensions need an MCP transport that drives the real extension code, a
     `program` grader, and a `tags.boundary` saying what the eval does and
     doesn't prove. See [Extensions](#extensions).
4. Tag every case with its assets and `tags.control: positive` or `negative`.
   Put a representative positive case in `tags.suite: smoke`. Prefix stimulus
   names with the plugin or skill name; names must be unique across all specs.
5. Run `npm run verify`, then run the eval, inspect its trajectory, and confirm
   that a wrong outcome would fail the graders.

[Write an eval, step by step](eval-authoring.md) has complete skill evals with
each part explained. `npm run new-plugin` writes one for each new plugin.

### Outcome graders

These count as outcome coverage for a positive case: `program`,
`output-matches`, `output-contains`, `file-matches`, `file-exists`, `prompt`,
and `panel`. For an MCP tool, a `tool-calls` rule that asserts the tool's
`result` counts too. `skill-invocation`, `tool-calls` without a result,
`completed`, `diff-empty`, and `output-not-matches` are useful, but don't count
on their own.

You don't need a custom `program` grader. Built-in graders are enough for many
skills. Write one when the outcome needs real parsing, such as checking a
generated file's structure.

### Negative controls

A negative case must assert something observable:

- Skill: a `skill-invocation` grader that disallows the skill, or any outcome
  or `tool-calls` grader.
- Agent, hook, or extension: an outcome grader or a `tool-calls` grader.
- MCP tool: a real call with an asserted error or result, or a `tool-calls`
  rule that disallows the tool.

A tag alone isn't coverage.

### Hooks

A hook eval mounts the real plugin with `agent_environment.env.STARTER_PLUGIN_DIRS`
and must show that the hook ran, not only that the model did the task. These
count:

- A `program` grader that checks the hook's real effects.
- A `tool-calls` rule whose `result` pattern includes the hook's
  `<plugin-name>:` prefix. Copilot appends a hook's `additionalContext` to the
  tool result, so only the hook can put it there. For a hook that reports
  rather than changes files, this is the honest evidence.
- An `output-matches`, `output-contains`, or `file-matches` grader whose
  pattern includes that prefix.

A `file-matches` or `file-exists` grader on content the model wrote doesn't
count: it passes even when the hook never ran. [Hooks](hooks.md) explains the
prefix convention.

### Extensions

A canvas extension's eval runs it through
[evals/support/canvas-host.mjs](../evals/support/canvas-host.mjs), a shared
MCP transport that loads the real `extension.mjs`, stands in for the host's
SDK, and exposes `list_canvas_capabilities`, `open_canvas`, and
`invoke_canvas_action`. A new extension needs only configuration: a
`.vally.yaml` param for its `extension.mjs` path, and a server entry like this:

```yaml
agent_environment:
  mcpServers:
    standup-host:
      type: stdio
      command: node
      args:
        - '${CANVAS_HOST}'
        - '${STANDUP_EXTENSION}'
        - --seed
        - '[{"action":"add_item","input":{"text":"Existing item"}}]'
```

`--seed` runs actions before the first call so every session starts the same;
`--canvas <id>` picks a canvas when the extension registers several. Grade the
outcome with a `program` grader that reads the actions' real results, and tag
the case `boundary: headless-sdk-contract`: the host proves the extension's
contract, not that any app renders it. `npm run new-plugin -- <name> --with extension`
sets all of this up, and `npm run verify` starts every canvas host an eval
configures to catch a broken path, canvas ID, or seed before a paid run.

## Asset identities

| Asset | `tags.assets` identity | Source layout |
|---|---|---|
| Skill | `skill:<plugin>/<skill-name>` | `plugins/<plugin>/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` |
| Custom agent | `agent:<plugin>/<agent-name>` | `plugins/<plugin>/com.github.copilot/agents/<agent-name>.agent.md` |
| Hook | `hook:<plugin>/<event-name>` | `plugins/<plugin>/com.github.copilot/hooks/hooks.json` |
| Canvas extension | `extension:<plugin>/<extension>` | `plugins/<plugin>/com.github.copilot/extensions/<extension>/extension.mjs` |
| MCP tool | `mcp:<plugin>/<server-name>/<tool-name>` | `plugins/<plugin>/mcp.json` |

The coverage check discovers every local skill, agent, hook, extension, and MCP
tool. It starts each local MCP server to read its real tool list. When
something's missing, it names the spec file, the case, and what to add, and it
reports every problem in one run. The shipped examples carry a few extra checks
tied to their exact asset IDs; they disappear when you rename or remove the
example.

Slash commands, rules, and LSP servers aren't invoked by the model the way
skills, agents, and tools are, so the coverage check doesn't require evals for
them. Test them by hand in the hosts you support.

## Suites

Suites are conventions, not fixed names. This repository's `smoke` suite
selects cases tagged `suite: smoke`, and `full` runs every spec. Upstream
github/evals examples filter on `lane: ci` instead. A `tags.suite` value must
match a suite filter in `.vally.yaml`, and every asset needs a case in `smoke`
because CI runs it by default.

## How the harness loads assets

The [launcher](../scripts/evals.mjs) runs Vally's `copilot-sdk` executor with the
pinned full Copilot CLI. The SDK's bundled standalone runtime can discover a
custom agent but won't run it, so the launcher sets `COPILOT_CLI_PATH` to a
small [runtime bridge](../scripts/eval-runtime.js) that starts the pinned
`@github/copilot` runtime with auto-update turned off. The bridge mounts each
directory listed in an eval's `STARTER_PLUGIN_DIRS` with `--plugin-dir`, so hook
cases load the real plugin without a global install or a folder-trust prompt.
`node scripts/eval-runtime.js --version` prints the pinned package version and
the version that actually runs.

MCP processes don't necessarily start in this checkout, so the launcher reads
`params` from `.vally.yaml` and passes every value that contains a slash as an
absolute path. Other params pass through unchanged.

## Results

Each local run writes JSONL results, a Markdown report, JUnit, and session
evidence under a timestamped `vally-results/` directory. Report on it with the
same selection you ran: `--suite smoke` after `npm run eval:smoke`,
`--suite full` after `npm run eval`, or `--eval-spec <path>` after one spec.
`--run-dir PATH` selects a saved run. An incomplete run, unexpected skip,
runtime error, or grader infrastructure error fails reporting. Valid failed
verdicts stay visible but don't fail the command; add `--require-pass` to the
eval command when you want them to.

`npm run eval:grade -- --help` shows Vally's options for re-grading saved
evidence. Re-grading code-based assertions doesn't need another model run.
