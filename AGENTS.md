# Maintaining this marketplace

Follow [README.md](README.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), and the
guides in [docs/](docs/) for team setup, package layout, installation,
versioning, validation, evals, CI, and host checks. Update those instructions in
place; don't duplicate them here.

## Agent-specific rules

- Scaffold a plugin with `npm run new-plugin -- <name>` (with `--with agent`,
  `mcp`, `hook`, or `extension`, and `--no-skill` when it has no skill), remove
  one with `npm run remove-plugin -- <name>` (`remove-example` for the shipped
  examples), and rename the marketplace with `npm run rename-marketplace`,
  rather than editing the catalog, overlay, and `.vally.yaml` by hand. Name a
  plugin's support files after it (`evals/graders/<name>.mjs`,
  `test/<name>-*.test.mjs`) so removal finds them.
- Group plugins by workflow, not by asset type. Keep every in-repo example
  self-contained and independently installable, without external services.
  Remote catalog references are separate from the local examples.
- Keep `.vally.yaml` in step with the plugins: `paths.skills` lists every
  plugin's `skills` directory, and path `params` point at files that exist.
  Live-repository tests check invariants, not a fixed plugin list; put
  example-specific assertions in tests that skip when the example is gone, and
  list every file an example owns in [scripts/examples.mjs](scripts/examples.mjs).
- Use the Agent Plugins 1.0 layout: root `plugin.json`, `skills/`, and `mcp.json`.
  Copilot agents (`agents/`), slash commands (`commands/`), rules (`rules/`),
  hooks (`hooks/hooks.json`), LSP servers (`lsp.json`), and SDK extensions
  (`extensions/`) live under `com.github.copilot/`. Check the
  [plugin reference](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-plugin-reference#components)
  before adding a component type the examples don't show. Don't ship rules or
  slash commands until the reference documents their file format; validation
  only checks that those files aren't empty. Use a skill for shared standards.
  Don't adopt legacy `.plugin/` or `.claude-plugin/` layouts from documentation.
  VS Code automation templates (`automations/*.automation.md` at the plugin
  root) are a VS Code-only capability, not an Agent Plugins 1.0 component, and
  `verify` doesn't check them.
- Instruction files (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `*.instructions.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`) and prompt files apply only to the repository they're in. To
  share guidance through the marketplace, package it as a skill or agent, as
  [docs/customization-types.md](docs/customization-types.md) explains.
- Don't add a UI framework or database. Never vendor the runtime SDK. The only
  build step regenerates committed artifacts (the MCP server bundle, the
  authoring grader, and their notices). Run `npm run build` after changing their
  sources and commit the generated files with the change. Never make an
  installed plugin depend on this checkout's `node_modules`.
- Skill and agent descriptions explain when to invoke them. Put detailed
  instructions in the body, and don't duplicate a skill as a command.
- Formatter hooks must not return permission decisions. Return `{}` for no-ops,
  and never describe the hook as a security boundary or replacement for CI.
  Prefix hook messages with `<plugin-name>:`, and never put file contents or raw
  parser messages in them. See [docs/hooks.md](docs/hooks.md).
- Don't claim a customization type works in a host unless official docs say so;
  keep the matrix in [docs/customization-types.md](docs/customization-types.md)
  in step, and write "not verified" where they don't.
- Preserve coverage when replacing an example; don't delete tests just to
  make validation pass.
- Keep evals outside plugins, grouped by workflow under `evals/`. Update the
  corresponding evals whenever adding or changing an in-repo skill, agent, hook,
  extension, or MCP tool. Don't replace real skill, tool, or agent invocation
  assertions with output keywords. Keep eval-only transports and development
  dependencies outside `plugins/`. Headless contract results aren't proof of
  native canvas rendering.
- Never stage answer keys or eval specifications into the agent's workspace. Use
  only synthetic fixtures and disposable directories, not git worktrees.
- Inspect failed trajectories before changing assertions. Don't loosen a check
  just to get green results, and don't accept the default agent's answer when a
  custom agent failed to launch. A grader infrastructure exception must report
  `status: error`, not a failed behavioral verdict.
- Valid behavioral failures may be report-only locally; tooling, configuration,
  and grader errors must fail. Never hide failures with blanket catches or
  `continue-on-error`.
- `npm run eval:smoke`, `npm run eval`, and the evals workflow spend AI
  credits. Don't run them unless the user asks, and don't turn on
  `ENABLE_EVALS` for anyone. Static checks don't establish behavioral quality.
- When upgrading Vally or Copilot, update the pins, the lockfile, and the
  workflow's `vally-version` together, and verify real custom-agent delegation
  and MCP behavior, not only schema validity. When you touch the workflows,
  refresh every action's commit SHA (with its version comment), keep the
  evals workflow on a Node major that `validate.yml` tests, and keep both eval
  runner jobs (`action` and `npm`) in step.
- Keep remote plugins opt-in. The repository settings overlay must never enable
  a remote plugin; that's a deliberate security rule, so developers install
  remote plugins themselves. A remote entry's `name` must match the upstream
  `plugin.json` name, and its source must pin a full `sha` and should name its
  `ref`. `npm run check-remotes` checks pins against GitHub; it uses the
  network, so keep it out of `verify`. Validate
  catalog metadata without fetching or executing upstream code in checks, and
  document private-repository access. Don't claim the local evals cover remote
  assets.
- Keep secrets and token-bearing URLs out of files. Use host authentication
  for private repositories, not embedded credentials. Never copy private
  organizational code into the examples.
- Do not commit, push, publish, change visibility, or modify GitHub permissions
  unless the user requests it.
