# JSON configuration

A portable skill and a self-contained local MCP server for checking JSON and
looking up values by JSON Pointer.

| Asset | Use when |
|---|---|
| `json-configuration` skill | Validating supplied JSON or finding a specific configuration value |
| `validate_json` tool | Checking syntax and reporting the JSON type or `INVALID_JSON` |
| `get_json_value` tool | Reading a value by RFC 6901 JSON Pointer, with `NOT_FOUND` and `INVALID_POINTER` errors |

## Install

```sh
copilot plugin marketplace add OWNER/REPO
copilot plugin install json-configuration@MARKETPLACE
```

Replace `OWNER/REPO` with the GitHub repository that hosts this marketplace
and `MARKETPLACE` with the `name` in its `marketplace.json`. See
[Install plugins](../../README.md#install-plugins) for VS Code.

## How it works

[mcp.json](mcp.json) starts `node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/server.mjs` over stdio.
The committed bundle includes its dependencies, so installed copies don't run
`npm install`. Its third-party licenses are in
[dist/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt](dist/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt).

The tool handlers only work on the JSON you pass them: they don't read files,
use credentials, make network requests, or save the JSON. That describes this
code, not a sandbox. The server is an ordinary Node.js process with your
account's permissions, so review any change to its bundle, and remember that
Copilot and its model see the JSON you send and the results. Input is limited
to 1,048,576 characters, and parse errors don't quote the input.
Numbers follow finite JavaScript number rules; overflowing values are rejected
instead of becoming `null`. Represent exact large integers or decimals as JSON
strings.

## Requirements

Node.js 22.14 or newer on the machine that runs Copilot.

## Try it

> Use json-configuration to validate {"port":8443} and look up /port.

## Develop

Edit [src/server.ts](src/server.ts), then run `npm run build` at the repository
root to regenerate `dist/server.mjs` and its notices. `npm run verify` fails if
the committed bundle is stale. Commit the source and generated files together.
